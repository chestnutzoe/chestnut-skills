# Chestnut 爆款文案 SOP

This is Zoe/Chestnut's copy production method packaged for public users.

Use it with the user's generated `文风说明.md`:

- `文风说明.md` answers: does this sound like the user?
- Chestnut 爆款文案 SOP answers: is this worth making, does it have a strong angle, and can it travel across platforms?
- `publish_draft.py` answers: how does the final local draft land in the WeChat backend?

The product logic is: **user voice outside, Chestnut Copy method inside**.

If this skill runs inside Zoe's AI Workshop and the installed `chestnut-copy` skill is available, use that installed skill instead because it is the live source of truth.

## Core Belief

AI is a copy assistant, not a ghostwriter.

The creator keeps:

- point of view,
- taste,
- lived stories,
- final judgment,
- publishing approval.

AI helps:

- organize messy thoughts,
- find audience pain,
- build structure,
- surface hooks,
- force real cover/title/hook decisions,
- scan retention risk before publishing,
- remove AI flavor,
- adapt the mother draft across platforms,
- prepare the final draft for review.

## Chestnut Rule 1: Persona Is Oxygen

The content must contain enough "you".

Personal presence is not decoration. Without creator presence, readers may consume the information but forget who said it.

Check:

- Is there a lived scene?
- Is there a real preference or judgment?
- Is there a contradiction, mistake, or discovery?
- Does the reader learn something about the creator's worldview?

## Chestnut Rule 2: No Preachy Voice

The stance is not "I am above you teaching you."

The stance is:

- "I tried this."
- "I learned this the hard way."
- "This is how I now think about it."
- "Maybe this helps you too."

Replace:

- "你应该..." -> "我是这么做的..."
- "正确做法是..." -> "我试过之后发现..."
- "大多数人不懂..." -> "我之前也不懂..."
- "真正的高手..." -> "我从这件事里学到..."
- "你必须..." -> "我后来意识到..."

## Step 0: Intake

Assume the user is a writing beginner unless their request clearly shows otherwise. Use plain language and do not require them to understand internal workflow names or copywriting terminology.

The user may provide:

- a fragment,
- messy voice-note style thoughts,
- a hot topic,
- a title,
- a draft,
- a transcript,
- a vague content idea.

Do not jump into final copy. Identify what decision is needed from the user's material and request.

When the user provides a script, transcript, or draft, diagnose before rewriting. First identify what is already working and what must remain. Do not treat every sentence as something that needs improvement, and do not force a full report when the user only needs a light proofread.

Choose the depth from the user's wording:

- `分析 / 诊断 / 有没有吸引力 / 有什么风险 / 发布前检查` -> give a thorough diagnosis.
- `顺一下 / 润色 / 改顺 / 精准一点 / 不要大改` -> make concise local edits.
- `帮我看看 / 看一下这个` with no clear depth -> give a quick useful judgment first, then ask whether the user wants a full diagnosis.

Do not ask only `要不要完整诊断？` Explain what the option means in beginner-friendly language:

```text
我可以继续做一次完整检查：看看这条最吸引人的点够不够强、选的痛点是不是最值得讲、标题封面和开头是否一致、观众可能在哪里划走，以及哪些内容一定要保留。你需要我继续吗？
```

If a serious problem is already obvious, state the single highest-priority red light before asking. The question must not prevent useful feedback or conceal material publishing risk.

## Step 1: Simplified Topic Gate

Before drafting, judge whether the idea should become content now.

Return one:

- **WRITE**: worth making; explain why.
- **KILL**: not worth making now; explain the weak point.
- **PIVOT**: worth making only if reframed; give a stronger angle.

If multiple directions are viable, give 2-4 options with:

- target audience,
- core pain point,
- promise,
- risk,
- recommended platform/form.

Stop for user confirmation when changing the audience, argument, or personal story would change the whole piece.

Keep this gate compact. It is a baseline editorial decision, not a full research report. Check only:

- why the audience should care now,
- the strongest specific value, tension, or discovery in the material,
- what creator experience, proof, or judgment makes this version distinct.

## Step 2: Audience Insight

Before drafting, produce practical audience insight:

- 2 target audience roles, each with a real situation and struggle.
- 3 concrete pain points, sorted by urgency.
- 3 cognitive blind spots, each as a counterintuitive sentence plus one-line explanation.
- 3 urgent desires, described as outcomes or lived states.
- 5 urgent questions with possible solutions.

Keep everything scene-based and human. Avoid abstract labels that could apply to anyone.

## Step 3: Structure

Recommend the structure that fits the topic. Do not force a fixed formula.

Useful patterns:

- story -> realization -> method,
- misconception -> proof -> reframe,
- pain -> why common fixes fail -> better system,
- personal experience -> broader insight -> actionable path,
- QESA / SCOPE / AIDA / PASTOR when genuinely useful,
- custom structure when the content needs it.

Give the recommended structure first, then 1-2 alternatives only if useful.

## Step 4: Outline

Create an outline before drafting.

Include:

- opening hook,
- what each section must prove,
- where the creator's personal story belongs,
- where specific time/place/person/number details are needed,
- where examples, contrast, or questions should appear,
- what the reader should feel or decide after each section.

## Step 5: Human Texture Gate

Before final drafting, stop and ask for human details unless the user already provided enough.

Ask:

- What is your real experience with this topic?
- Is there a concrete time, place, person, number, or scene?
- Is there a real DM, comment, friend conversation, community question, or client moment?
- Is there an imperfect part: hesitation, contradiction, embarrassment, failure, or reversal?
- What do you actually believe here?

Do not fabricate personal stories. If the user skips this gate, mark the draft as lower-confidence and explain what is missing.

## Step 6: Drafting

Draft only after the direction and human texture are clear enough.

Rules:

- Use the user's `文风说明.md` for voice.
- Preserve the user's point of view, story, and judgment.
- Use specific scenes instead of generic concepts.
- Do not over-market.
- Do not sound like a polished AI essay.
- Do not flatten contradictions; tension often makes content stronger.
- Keep the mother-draft argument clear enough to become video, social captions, or newsletter later.

## Step 7: Cover / Title / Hook Decision Gate

This is a mandatory decision gate. Many creators do not fail because the draft is empty; they fail because the cover/title/hook are vague, safe, or mismatched.

Do not treat cover/title/hook as decoration at the end. Force the user to think and choose.

### Three Different Jobs

| Piece | Job | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Cover | make people stop | Would this catch the eye in one second? |
| Title | make people click / open | Is the conflict or promise clear? |
| Hook | make people continue | Does the first 3-10 seconds create forward pull? |

All three must make the same core promise. A strong cover cannot rescue a title and opening that lead somewhere else.

### Psychological Starting Mechanism

Before writing combinations, decide what should make the audience react:

- pain recognition,
- curiosity gap,
- risk warning,
- contrarian belief,
- desired result,
- vulnerability,
- identity call-out,
- another mechanism justified by the material.

Do not select a mechanism because it sounds dramatic. Select it because it matches the audience's current psychology and the content can fulfill the promise.

If the mechanism is pain recognition, run a pain-priority test:

1. List the 2-3 plausible pains inside this topic.
2. Ask which pain is most urgent, specific, and actionable for the target audience.
3. Prefer the pain with the highest stopping power that the content can genuinely resolve.
4. State why it was selected and what risk the weaker pains carry.

Do not default to the broadest pain or the easiest pain to phrase.

### Required Output

Create 3 cover/title/hook combinations. Each combination must have:

- **Cover**: short, visual, high-friction phrase.
- **Title**: clear conflict + promise.
- **Hook**: 2-3 spoken or written opening lines.
- **Main mechanism**: curiosity gap, pain recognition, contrarian trigger, risk warning, fast result, vulnerability, or identity call-out.
- **Best for**: stop, click, retention, or balanced.
- **Risk**: what might make this combo underperform.

Then ask the user to choose one:

`你要选哪一组？如果不确定，我会默认推荐第 X 组，因为它最适合当前内容目标。`

Do not finalize the copy package until a combination is chosen or a default is explicitly stated.

### Combo Checklist

Each selected combo must pass:

- Cover is not a full sentence.
- Title is not just a topic label.
- Hook does not start with long background.
- Cover/title/hook point to the same promise.
- At least one of the three contains a concrete person, scene, number, result, or pain.
- No preachy voice.

## Step 8: Retention Gate

This is mandatory when the output may become video, short-form content, or any content where the opening sequence matters.

Core rule:

> People do not stay because you have information. They stay because they want to know what happens next.

### 7 Narrative Pulls

Scan whether the draft has at least 4 active pulls:

1. Curiosity gap: something is not fully resolved.
2. Relatability: the audience recognizes themselves.
3. Rhythm shift: the piece does not stay flat.
4. Sensory detail: there are concrete scenes, not only concepts.
5. Real emotion: the creator felt something specific.
6. Forward promise: the audience senses more value is coming.
7. Meaning: the piece creates a small worldview shift.

If fewer than 4 are active, revise before finalizing.

### 8 Tactical Checks

Scan:

- First 10 seconds: result, conflict, contrast, or problem appears early.
- Every 30-60 seconds: there is new information or a new stimulus.
- Cuttable parts: if deleting a line does not hurt understanding, cut it.
- Rhythm: avoid one continuous explanation mode.
- Progression: the piece should move forward, not list parallel points.
- Ending: give a next step, lingering question, or meaning point.
- Retention review: after publishing, use the retention curve to identify drop points.
- Human language: rewrite lecture/summary tone into first-person scene or real talk.

### Three Baseline Red Flags

Keep the embedded retention check lightweight, but always scan these three high-impact risks:

1. **Cold viewer**: if this is the audience's first exposure to the creator, can they understand the problem and reason to stay within the opening?
2. **Problem chain**: does each section answer the previous question and create the next one, or does the draft feel like a parallel list or course outline?
3. **Mainline overload**: is the piece trying to carry too many useful branches, causing the central promise to disappear?

If any red flag is active, mark it clearly and give a concrete repair. Do not expand this embedded check into a full analytics or post-publish review.

### Required Output

Before final delivery, include:

- retention risk: high / medium / low,
- predicted drop point,
- which narrative pulls are active,
- which pulls are missing,
- 3 concrete fixes.

## Step 9: Self-Edit

After drafting, diagnose and improve:

- Is the logic clear?
- Where might the reader be confused?
- Which claims need an example?
- Which lines sound too written, official, or AI-like?
- What is repetitive and can be cut?
- Does the opening make someone continue?
- Is the title/cover/hook strong enough?
- Does the piece have a real human moment?
- Does it carry a clear point of view?

Give targeted edits before a full rewrite when the user provided a draft.

For an existing script, transcript, or draft:

- surface the strongest reason someone may watch or read,
- say what should be preserved before proposing changes,
- diagnose only the risks relevant to the user's request,
- prioritize changes that materially improve comprehension, attraction, retention, accuracy, or voice,
- provide sentence-level alternatives while preserving intent and speaking rhythm.

Do not provide a full rewritten transcript by default. Rewrite the whole piece only when the user asks or when local edits cannot repair the structure. Let the response feel like useful editorial feedback, not a mandatory template.

## Step 10: Output Package

For final deliverables, provide what the task needs:

- final mother draft,
- selected cover/title/hook combo,
- 3 backup title options,
- 3 digest/summary options,
- cover decision:
  - ask whether the user already has a cover image or `thumb_media_id`,
  - if yes, prepare the WeChat draft command with that cover,
  - if no, provide 3 cover directions or AI image-generation prompts,
- retention risk and fixes,
- platform adaptation notes,
- publishing checklist.

## Step 11: Next-Step Reminder

Never assume the user will remember the next workflow step. Infer the current stage, then recommend exactly one next action when a meaningful step is still missing:

- idea only -> confirm the angle,
- draft in progress -> confirm what must be preserved,
- final draft before filming -> run a pre-publish data check,
- filmed but not published -> check the opening, rhythm, and cuttable sections,
- published -> return with performance screenshots or a retention curve for review.

Do not list every next action at once.

If requested, prepare the WeChat draft box upload, but do not publish automatically. A real WeChat draft needs either a local cover image path or an existing permanent-material `thumb_media_id`.

## Platform Adaptation

### WeChat Mother Draft

Use for:

- full argument,
- deeper personal story,
- complete context,
- audience trust,
- private-domain transfer.

Keep this as the source text when possible.

### Video Script

Adapt by:

- compressing explanation,
- making the first 3-5 seconds sharper,
- turning sections into spoken beats,
- preserving the core argument,
- moving proof and examples earlier.

### RedNote / Xiaohongshu

Adapt by:

- sharpening the title and cover hook,
- turning long arguments into card-worthy claims,
- making the caption more direct,
- preserving one strong human scene,
- avoiding generic self-help wording.

### YouTube / Bilibili

Adapt by:

- expanding proof and examples,
- making the opening promise clear,
- adding chapter logic,
- keeping story and worldview visible.

### Newsletter / Community

Adapt by:

- making the opening more intimate,
- using fewer platform hooks,
- adding a clearer CTA or reflection prompt.

## Anti-AI Checks

Flag and revise:

- "在当今时代..." style openings,
- overly balanced three-part explanations,
- generic advice without a scene,
- motivational closure without a real point,
- too many rhetorical questions,
- overuse of "核心", "本质", "关键" without proof,
- paragraphs that explain everything but reveal nothing.

## Publishing Boundary

AI can move the workflow forward, but cannot decide the creator's:

- belief,
- personal story,
- final judgment,
- final publishing action.

For WeChat, default to draft-box creation and manual backend review.
