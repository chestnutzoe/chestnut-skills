  Use when a Chinese creator wants to write, rewrite, evaluate, or adapt copy
  with Zoe/Chestnut's copywriting method. Also use to review an existing
  script, transcript, or draft before filming or publishing: diagnose what
  attracts viewers, topic and audience risks, cover/title/hook alignment,
  retention risks, off-voice lines, and precise edits without rewriting for
  the sake of rewriting.

# 爆款文案 SOP

## Purpose

This skill packages Zoe/Chestnut's copy production method for public users.

It answers one question:

> 这篇内容有没有传播力？

It can run alone, but works best with a user-specific `文风说明.md` from the `文风分析` skill.

## How It Connects

The full Chestnut Copy skill set has three independent skills:

1. 文风分析: use the creator's own writing samples to answer `像不像你`.
2. 爆款文案 SOP: use this method to answer `有没有传播力`.
3. 公众号发布: send an approved draft to the WeChat draft box.

If a `文风说明.md` exists, load it before drafting. If not, ask whether the user wants to provide samples or continue with the SOP only.

## Required Reference

Read `references/chestnut-copy-sop.md` when writing, rewriting, evaluating, or adapting copy.

That file contains the detailed workflow:

- input-aware drafting and feedback,
- topic gate,
- audience insight,
- pain-point sorting,
- structure,
- outline,
- human texture gate,
- drafting,
- cover/title/hook decision gate,
- retention gate,
- self-edit,
- output package,
- platform adaptation,
- anti-AI checks.

## Core Rules

- Assume the user is a writing beginner unless their request shows otherwise. Do not expect them to know terms such as topic gate, hook mechanism, retention pull, or full diagnosis.
- When the user provides a script, transcript, or draft for feedback, diagnose before rewriting.
- Identify what must be preserved before suggesting what should change.
- Prefer targeted, sentence-level edits. Do not rewrite for the sake of rewriting.
- Do not jump straight to final copy when the angle is weak.
- Do not let the user skip cover/title/hook decisions; this is where many creators lose reach.
- Do not fabricate personal stories.
- Keep the user's point of view, lived scenes, and final judgment visible.
- Keep voice and layout separate.
- When the content may become video or short-form, include a retention scan.
- Never silently skip the next workflow stage. End with the current stage and one concrete next-step reminder.

When responding to an existing draft, adapt the depth and format to the user's request:

- If the user asks for analysis, diagnosis, audience attraction, publishing risk, or a pre-publish check, provide a thorough diagnosis.
- If the user asks to smooth, proofread, tighten, or lightly edit without major changes, make concise local edits.
- If the user only says "帮我看看" or the desired depth is unclear, give a useful quick judgment first, then ask whether they want a full diagnosis. Explain in plain language that a full diagnosis checks content appeal, audience pain, cover/title/opening alignment, likely drop points, what must stay, and what should change.
- If a serious risk is already obvious, flag the single most important red light before asking. Do not hide a material problem behind the user's uncertainty.

Do not force a full diagnostic report for a simple proofreading request. Do not output a full rewrite unless the user asks for one or the diagnosed structure cannot be repaired locally.

## Default Output Package

When the user asks for a publishable package, provide only what the task needs, choosing from:

- topic verdict: `WRITE`, `PIVOT`, or `KILL`,
- audience insight,
- stronger angle options,
- outline,
- final mother draft,
- 3 cover/title/hook combinations,
- selected or recommended combo,
- retention risk and fixes,
- 3 digest or summary options,
- platform adaptation notes,
- publishing checklist.

## Cover / Title / Hook Gate

Always force a real decision when preparing publishable copy.

Create 3 combinations. Each combination must include:

- cover phrase,
- title,
- hook,
- main mechanism,
- best use,
- risk.

Before creating combinations, choose the psychological starting mechanism: pain recognition, curiosity gap, risk warning, contrarian belief, desired result, vulnerability, identity call-out, or another justified mechanism.

If using pain recognition, first test whether this is the audience's most urgent and actionable pain for this topic. Do not choose a pain merely because it is easy to phrase. Compare plausible pains and explain why the selected one has the strongest stopping power.

Then ask:

```text
你要选哪一组？如果不确定，我会默认推荐第 X 组，因为它最适合当前内容目标。
```

## Retention Gate

When the draft may become video or short-form content, include:

- retention risk: high / medium / low,
- predicted drop point,
- cold-viewer comprehension risk,
- problem-chain vs list-like progression,
- mainline overload or removable branches,
- active narrative pulls,
- missing narrative pulls,
- 3 concrete fixes.

## Next-Step Reminder

At the end, infer the current workflow stage and give one useful next action when a meaningful step is still missing. Do not show a mandatory progress report, and do not dump every possible next step on the user.

## Publishing Boundary

This skill can prepare a WeChat-ready mother draft, title, digest, and cover direction. It does not upload drafts by itself.

If the user wants to upload to WeChat, hand off to `公众号发布`.
